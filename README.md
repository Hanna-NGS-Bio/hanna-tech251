<h1>Hi, I'm Hanna!

<h2>👨‍💻 Bioinformatic Experience (Foundational):</h2>

- <b> R and R studio for differential expression analysis (using DESeq2 Package)</b>
  - Data normalization and filtering of lowly expressed genes
  - Generated Volcano plots, Heatmaps, PCA plots, and Venn diagrams
- <b> Python (Basic Machine Learning workflow)
   - Built a simple random forest classifers with train/test splits</b>
   - Implemented in Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code

<h2>Project:</h2>

- <b> cfRNA Differential Expression Analysis – Explored gene expression differences across samples using DESeq2</b>
  - RNA-seq Data Visualization – Created Volcano plots, Heatmaps, PCA plots, and Venn diagrams to summarize results

<h2>More From Me</h2>

- 🔭 I’m have been working on basic machine learning using small gene count data
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python at a basic level
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am primarily a lab researcher (both in academic and industry) who wants to keep up with the world of data!
